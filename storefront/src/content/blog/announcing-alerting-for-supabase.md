We are excited to introduce **alerting functionality** to Supafana, enhancing your observability and monitoring experience for Supabase. With this new feature, your hosted Grafana and Prometheus stack now includes **pre-configured email alerts**, keeping you informed about critical infrastructure metrics like high CPU usage, low RAM, low disk space, and high connection counts.
